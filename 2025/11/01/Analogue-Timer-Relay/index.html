Against the technological and market backdrop of that era, this path was fraught with challenges, yet also held hidden opportunities for breakthroughs.<br>At that time, MCUs, which were revolutionizing the market, had only just begun to be widely applied in the consumer electronics sector. In consumer electronics scenarios, products had relatively low requirements for anti-interference capabilities, as their operating environments were stable, mostly confined to spaces like homes and offices with few interference sources. Meanwhile, limited by the chip manufacturing technology of the day, the ROM (Read-Only Memory) capacity of these MCUs was generally small, resulting in limited storage capabilities. Furthermore, software development relied entirely on assembly language. While assembly language offered certain advantages in execution efficiency, it was extremely difficult to write and had poor readability, posing significant challenges for subsequent modifications and maintenance — this was the common technical status quo across the industry at that time.<br>My exploration, however, aimed precisely to break through these limitations in technological application: introducing MCUs, originally designed for consumer electronics, into the field of industrial analog time-delay relays, where demands for performance and stability are far more stringent. The industrial environment is vastly different from that of consumer electronics — the operation of motors in workshops, the startup and shutdown of equipment, and fluctuations in the power grid all generate a large number of interference signals. If a relay lacks sufficient anti-interference capabilities, it may at best lead to deviations in delay accuracy, and at worst, directly cause equipment failures and trigger production accidents. Therefore, enhancing the product’s anti-interference capability became the core task during the R&amp;D process.<br>To adapt MCUs to industrial scenarios, we conducted countless tests and modifications:</p>
<h2 id="At-the-hardware-level"><a href="#At-the-hardware-level" class="headerlink" title="At the hardware level:"></a>At the hardware level:</h2><p>We optimized circuit layouts, added filtering modules, and strengthened the power supply’s resistance to fluctuations.</p>
<h2 id="At-the-software-level"><a href="#At-the-software-level" class="headerlink" title="At the software level:"></a>At the software level:</h2><p>We wrote redundant code using assembly language and integrated interference detection and error correction logic, ensuring that delay timing remained stable even in complex electromagnetic environments.<br>Each test simulated extreme conditions that might occur in industrial settings, and each modification targeted and optimized the problems exposed during testing. It was through this repeated refinement that the product’s anti-interference capability ultimately met industrial-grade standards, enabling it to operate reliably in harsh production environments.<br>Beyond the breakthrough in anti-interference capability, the introduction of MCUs also brought two key advantages to the production of analog time-delay relays:<br>Flexible delay time setting: We adopted ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) technology. Compared with traditional large-scale integrated circuits, which relied on complex hardware circuits to adjust delays, ADC-based setting was far more flexible and convenient. Different delay requirements could be achieved simply by modifying software parameters, which greatly simplified the production process and reduced the risk of errors caused by hardware adjustments.<br>Enhanced product consistency: The standardized control logic of MCUs significantly improved the consistency of the products. Traditional analog time-delay relays were affected by the discreteness of component parameters, leading to large variations in delay accuracy between different batches and even within the same batch. However, the precise control of MCUs effectively avoided this issue, ensuring that the performance of each product remained highly consistent — a feature of great importance in industrial production, where strict precision requirements are commonplace.<br>That said, the market environment at the time also exerted considerable pressure on the project. Around 2000, the MCU industry on the Chinese mainland was still in its infancy, with immature technology and products still in the testing phase, unable to meet the reliability requirements of industrial-grade products. As a result, nearly all MCUs available on the market were produced in Taiwan, China. This not only limited the choices for MCU procurement but also directly drove up the cost of core components — MCUs were generally expensive at that time. Although the application of MCUs reduced manual debugging costs and simplified the production process, the high cost of core chips still caused the overall product cost to be higher than that of traditional analog time-delay relays.<br>Faced with the reality of increased costs, whether to continue advancing the project became a matter requiring careful consideration. However, from the perspective of technological development trends and industrial market demand, empowering industrial control with MCUs was an inevitable direction: the improved precision, guaranteed consistency, and production flexibility it brought were irreplaceable by traditional technologies, and these advantages were exactly what industrial customers urgently needed. Even though costs rose in the short term, in the long run, as MCU technology matured and costs decreased, and with the technological barriers established by the product in the market, the project’s value would eventually become apparent. It was based on this judgment of technological prospects and insight into industrial market demand that we finally decided to move forward, launching this MCU-powered industrial analog time-delay relay into the market and accumulating valuable practical experience for subsequent technological upgrades in the industrial control field.<br>Looking back on this R&amp;D and production experience in 2000, it was not only a cross-domain application of technology but also an exploration of balancing market needs and technological advancement. From the leap of applying consumer electronics MCUs to industrial-grade relays, to the repeated refinement of anti-interference technology, and the proactive overcoming of cost dilemmas — every step was filled with challenges. Yet, it also allowed us to deeply understand the role of technological innovation in driving industrial upgrading: even in the early stages of immature technology and high costs, as long as the direction is correct and we persist in technological breakthroughs, we can open up new paths for the development of the industry.</p>
