Against the technological and market backdrop of that era, this path was fraught with challenges, yet also held hidden opportunities for breakthroughs.At that time, MCUs, which were revolutionizing the market, had only just begun to be widely applied in the consumer electronics sector. In consumer electronics scenarios, products had relatively low requirements for anti-interference capabilities, as their operating environments were stable, mostly confined to spaces like homes and offices with few interference sources. Meanwhile, limited by the chip manufacturing technology of the day, the ROM (Read-Only Memory) capacity of these MCUs was generally small, resulting in limited storage capabilities. Furthermore, software development relied entirely on assembly language. While assembly language offered certain advantages in execution efficiency, it was extremely difficult to write and had poor readability, posing significant challenges for subsequent modifications and maintenance — this was the common technical status quo across the industry at that time.My exploration, however, aimed precisely to break through these limitations in technological application: introducing MCUs, originally designed for consumer electronics, into the field of industrial analog time-delay relays, where demands for performance and stability are far more stringent. The industrial environment is vastly different from that of consumer electronics — the operation of motors in workshops, the startup and shutdown of equipment, and fluctuations in the power grid all generate a large number of interference signals. If a relay lacks sufficient anti-interference capabilities, it may at best lead to deviations in delay accuracy, and at worst, directly cause equipment failures and trigger production accidents. Therefore, enhancing the product’s anti-interference capability became the core task during the R&amp;D process.To adapt MCUs to industrial scenarios, we conducted countless tests and modifications: At the hardware level:We optimized circuit layouts, added filtering modules, and strengthened the power supply’s resistance to fluctuations. At the software level:We wrote redundant code using assembly language and integrated interference detection and error correction logic, ensuring that delay timing remained stable even in complex electromagnetic environments.Each test simulated extreme conditions that might occur in industrial settings, and each modification targeted and optimized the problems exposed during testing. It was through this repeated refinement that the product’s anti-interference capability ultimately met industrial-grade standards, enabling it to operate reliably in harsh production environments.Beyond the breakthrough in anti-interference capability, the introduction of MCUs also brought two key advantages to the production of analog time-delay relays:Flexible delay time setting: We adopted ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) technology. Compared with traditional large-scale integrated circuits, which relied on complex hardware circuits to adjust delays, ADC-based setting was far more flexible and convenient. Different delay requirements could be achieved simply by modifying software parameters, which greatly simplified the production process and reduced the risk of errors caused by hardware adjustments.Enhanced product consistency: The standardized control logic of MCUs significantly improved the consistency of the products. Traditional analog time-delay relays were affected by the discreteness of component parameters, leading to large variations in delay accuracy between different batches and even within the same batch. However, the precise control of MCUs effectively avoided this issue, ensuring that the performance of each product remained highly consistent — a feature of great importance in industrial production, where strict precision requirements are commonplace.That said, the market environment at the time also exerted considerable pressure on the project. Around 2000, the MCU industry on the Chinese mainland was still in its infancy, with immature technology and products still in the testing phase, unable to meet the reliability requirements of industrial-grade products. As a result, nearly all MCUs available on the market were produced in Taiwan, China. This not only limited the choices for MCU procurement but also directly drove up the cost of core components — MCUs were generally expensive at that time. Although the application of MCUs reduced manual debugging costs and simplified the production process, the high cost of core chips still caused the overall product cost to be higher than that of traditional analog time-delay relays.Faced with the reality of increased costs, whether to continue advancing the project became a matter requiring careful consideration. However, from the perspective of technological development trends and industrial market demand, empowering industrial control with MCUs was an inevitable direction: the improved precision, guaranteed consistency, and production flexibility it brought were irreplaceable by traditional technologies, and these advantages were exactly what industrial customers urgently needed. Even though costs rose in the short term, in the long run, as MCU technology matured and costs decreased, and with the technological barriers established by the product in the market, the project’s value would eventually become apparent. It was based on this judgment of technological prospects and insight into industrial market demand that we finally decided to move forward, launching this MCU-powered industrial analog time-delay relay into the market and accumulating valuable practical experience for subsequent technological upgrades in the industrial control field.Looking back on this R&amp;D and production experience in 2000, it was not only a cross-domain application of technology but also an exploration of balancing market needs and technological advancement. From the leap of applying consumer electronics MCUs to industrial-grade relays, to the repeated refinement of anti-interference technology, and the proactive overcoming of cost dilemmas — every step was filled with challenges. Yet, it also allowed us to deeply understand the role of technological innovation in driving industrial upgrading: even in the early stages of immature technology and high costs, as long as the direction is correct and we persist in technological breakthroughs, we can open up new paths for the development of the industry.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Market Transformation of Analog Time-Delay Relays","slug":"Market-Transformation-of-Analog-Time-Delay-Relays","date":"2025-10-28T07:56:57.392Z","updated":"2025-11-01T02:26:28.847Z","comments":true,"path":"2025/10/28/Market-Transformation-of-Analog-Time-Delay-Relays/","permalink":"https://global-oem.com/2025/10/28/Market-Transformation-of-Analog-Time-Delay-Relays/","excerpt":"","text":"Technological Development and Market Transformation of Analog Time-Delay RelaysI. Key Focuses of Product Technical Design and TestingIn the R&amp;D process of analog time-delay relays, the high requirements of industrial products for anti-interference capability and reset capability have become the core of technology. We prioritize the use of industrial-grade MCUs (Microcontroller Units) as the core control components; however, even with this choice, significant time is invested in two key testing tasks:Anti-interference Capability Testing: Aimed at the complex electromagnetic environment of industrial sites, this test simulates interference sources such as voltage fluctuations and electromagnetic radiation. It verifies the product’s ability to operate stably under harsh conditions, ensuring that the relay’s trigger signal does not malfunction due to external interference.Reset Capability Testing: This test addresses the strict requirements of industrial control cabinets — the product must quickly complete MCU reset at the moment of power failure. This ensures that when power is restored rapidly, the consistency of the time-delay duration and the speed of signal response meet industrial-grade standards, avoiding equipment control deviations caused by delayed reset.Among these, the power-failure reset design is a technical challenge. By optimizing the capacitor energy storage scheme of the MCU power supply circuit and the reset trigger logic, we ultimately achieved reset within 50ms after power failure, with the power-on time-delay error controlled within ±5%. This meets the reliability requirements for the continuous operation of industrial equipment. II. The Rise and Decline of Market Demand(1) Peak Market PeriodAnalog time-delay relays once occupied an important position in the industrial sector due to their stable time-delay control function:Core Application Scenarios: Fully automatic dual-power controllers required 2 analog time-delay relays to achieve time-delay protection during power switching; a large number of small industrial equipment control consoles (such as machine tool control and assembly line speed control systems) also relied on this product to implement sequence control.Market Scale Advantages: The wide range of application scenarios drove continuous growth in market demand. Leveraging our mature technical solutions and stable product quality, we gained a substantial market share and became one of the mainstream suppliers in this niche segment. (2) Market Shrinkage StageWith the rapid development of PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) technology, the market structure underwent a fundamental change:Technology Substitution Effect: PLCs feature integrated control capabilities, enabling complex functions such as multi-channel time-delay and logical linkage through programming. A single PLC device can replace multiple analog time-delay relays, greatly simplifying circuit design and reducing failure rates. Most domestic industrial equipment manufacturers gradually shifted to PLC control solutions.Decline in Market Demand: The application scenarios for analog time-delay relays were rapidly compressed, and the market scale shrank year by year. Currently, they are only used in small quantities in countries with relatively backward industrial automation (such as some Southeast Asian and African countries). However, affected by the local industrial upgrading process, demand also shows a continuing downward trend. III. Transformation Strategies to Respond to Market ChangesTo adapt to the industry’s technological iteration and changes in market demand, we have formulated a transformation direction centered on product upgrading and scenario expansion:Product Integration Upgrade: Integrate the analog time-delay function into solid-state relays to develop solid-state time-delay relays. This product retains the original time-delay control function while inheriting the advantages of solid-state relays (such as contactless operation and long service life). It is suitable for the control needs of high-precision equipment, such as sequence control in medical devices and precision instruments.Expansion into the Industrial Control Module Field: Based on the accumulated experience in MCU control technology, we have developed a series of industrial control modules (including time-delay control modules, logic trigger modules, and signal conversion modules). Through modular design, these modules meet the auxiliary function requirements of PLC systems, enabling the transformation from a single relay product to diversified control components and entering the industrial automation supporting market.Through technological iteration and product structure adjustment, we will gradually reduce reliance on the traditional analog time-delay relay business, build a product system adapted to the PLC-dominated era, and achieve the sustainable development of the enterprise in the industrial control field.","categories":[],"tags":[]}],"categories":[],"tags":[]}
